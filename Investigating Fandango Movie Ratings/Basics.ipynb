    "# Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings\n",
    "In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis in this [article](https://www.fandango.com/) — a great piece of data journalism that's totally worth reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fandango displays a 5-star rating system on their website, where the minimum rating is 0 stars and the maximum is 5 stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal:\n",
    "In this project, we'll analyze recent movie ratings data of `Fandango` to determine whether there has been any change in `Fandango's` rating system after Hickey's analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data:\n",
    "One of the best ways to figure out whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis is to compare the system's characteristics previous and after the analysis. Fortunately, we have ready-made data for both these periods of time:\n",
    "\n",
    "Walt Hickey made the data he analyzed publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango). We'll use the data he collected to analyze the characteristics of Fandango's rating system previous to his analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Dataquest's team members collected movie ratings data for movies released in 2016 and 2017. The data is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17) and we'll use it to analyze the rating system's characteristics after Hickey's analysis."

    "Our goal is to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis. The population of interest for our analysis is made of all the movie ratings stored on Fandango's website, regardless of the releasing year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we want to find out whether the parameters of this population changed after Hickey's analysis, we're interested in sampling the population at two different periods in time — previous and after Hickey's analysis — so we can compare the two states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we're working with was sampled at the moments we want: one sample was taken previous to the analysis, and the other after the analysis. We want to describe the population, so we need to make sure that the samples are representative, otherwise we should expect a large sampling error and, ultimately, wrong conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Hickey's article and from the README.md of the data set's repository, we can see that he used the following sampling criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The movie must have had at least 30 fan ratings on Fandango's website at the time of sampling (Aug. 24, 2015).\n",
    "- The movie must have had tickets on sale in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling was clearly not random because not every movie had the same chance to be included in the sample — some movies didn't have a chance at all (like those having under 30 fan ratings or those without tickets on sale in 2015). It's questionable whether this sample is representative of the entire population we're interested to describe. It seems more likely that it isn't, mostly because this sample is subject to temporal trends — e.g. movies in 2015 might have been outstandingly good or bad compared to other years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling conditions for our other sample were (as it can be read in the README.md of the data set's [repository](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The movie must have been released in 2016 or later.\n",
    "- The movie must have had a considerable number of votes and reviews (unclear how many from the README.md or from the data).\n",

    "Both these authors had certain research questions in mind when they sampled the data, and they used a set of criteria to get a sample that would fit their questions. Their sampling method is called [purposive sampling](https://youtu.be/CdK7N_kTzHI) (or judgmental/selective/subjective sampling). While these samples were good enough for their research, they don't seem too useful for us.\n",

    "At this point, we can either collect new data or change our the goal of our analysis. We choose the latter and place some limitations on our initial goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis, our new goal is to determine whether there's any difference between Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2015 and Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2016. This new goal should also be a fairly good proxy for our initial goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Isolating the Samples We Need\n",
    "With this new research goal, we have two populations of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All Fandango's ratings for popular movies released in 2015.\n",
    "- All Fandango's ratings for popular movies released in 2016.\n",
    "We need to be clear about what counts as popular movies. We'll use Hickey's benchmark of 30 fan ratings and count a movie as popular only if it has 30 fan ratings or more on Fandango's website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although one of the sampling criteria in our second sample is movie popularity, the sample doesn't provide information about the number of fan ratings. We should be skeptical once more and ask whether this sample is truly representative and contains popular movies (movies with over 30 fan ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "One quick way to check the representativity of this sample is to sample randomly 10 movies from it and then check the number of fan ratings ourselves on Fandango's website. Ideally, at least 8 out of the 10 movies have 30 fan ratings or more.\n",
